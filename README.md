 Air Quality Sensing Using Arduino
This project is focused on the development of a low-cost and efficient air quality monitoring system using an Arduino Nano microcontroller. It utilizes the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and the MQ135 sensor to detect harmful gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), and benzene. The real-time air quality data is displayed on an OLED screen, offering valuable insights into the environmental conditions.

Key Features:
Real-time Monitoring: Provides continuous updates on air quality, temperature, and humidity.
Low-Cost: Uses affordable components like Arduino Nano, DHT11, and MQ135 sensors, making it suitable for personal and residential use.
OLED Display: Displays real-time data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality index (AQI) for easy visualization.
Air Quality Index (AQI): Classifies air quality into categories like "Good", "Poor", "Very Bad", and "Toxic" based on sensor readings.
Expandable: Can be integrated with IoT platforms like ThingSpeak for remote monitoring and logging.
Components Used:
Arduino Nano: The microcontroller that processes sensor data and drives the display.
DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
MQ135 Sensor: Detects harmful gases like CO2, NH3, and benzene, to assess air quality.
16x2 LCD with I2C: Displays the real-time data from sensors.
Breadboard and Wires: For assembling the circuit.
Project Goals:
To create a simple, cost-effective air quality monitoring system.
To provide real-time data on environmental conditions for public health awareness.
To enhance the system with potential future improvements, such as integrating IoT for remote monitoring and data analysis.
Future Scope:
IoT Integration: Uploading data to cloud platforms for real-time logging and remote access.
Additional Sensors: Adding more sensors like PM2.5 or UV to monitor particulate matter and radiation.
Smart City Applications: Expanding the system for large-scale deployments in urban areas for environmental management and health monitoring.
